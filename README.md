# nxapi-blocks
Commonly used requests for interacting with NX-OS / NXAPI devices.

Started this repo to add code blocks for NX-API tasks. 
The first addition 'authenticate-store-token.py' is a function that takes three arguments and returns the authentication token for use in subsequent requests.
You can use the script at the terminal by passing 'username' 'password' 'X.X.X.X' or import and use in your existing code.
